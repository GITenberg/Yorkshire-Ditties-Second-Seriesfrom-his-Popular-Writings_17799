<p>A poor owd man wi' tott'ring gait,<br>

Wi' body bent, and snowy pate,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Aw met one day;&mdash;</span><br>

An' daan o' th' rooad side grassy banks<br>

He sat to rest his weary shanks;<br>

An' aw, to wile away my time,<br>

O'th' neighbouring hillock did recline,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">An' bade "gooid day."</span><br>

</p>

<p>Said aw, "Owd friend, pray tell me true,<br>

If in your heart yo niver rue<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The time 'ats past?</span><br>

Does envy niver fill your breast<br>

When passin fowk wi' riches blest?<br>

An' do yo niver think it wrang<br>

At yo should have to trudge alang,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Soa poor to th' last?"</span><br>

</p>

<p>"Young man," he said "aw envy nooan;<br>

But ther are times aw pity some,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Wi' all mi heart;</span><br>

To see what troubled lives they spend,<br>

What cares upon their hands depend;<br>

Then aw in thoughtfulness declare<br>

'At 'little cattle little care'<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Is th' better part.</span><br>

</p>

<p>Gold is a burden hard to carry,<br>

An' tho' Dame Fortune has been chary<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">O' gifts to me;</span><br>

Yet still aw strive to feel content,<br>

An' think what is, for th' best is meant;<br>

An' th' mooast ov all aw strive for here,<br>

Is still to keep mi conscience clear,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">From dark spots free.</span><br>

</p>

<p>An' while some tax ther brains to find<br>

What they'll be forced to leave behind,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When th' time shall come;</span><br>

Aw try bi honest word an' deed,<br>

To get what little here aw need,<br>

An' live i' hopes at last to say,<br>

When breath go as flickerin away,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">'Awm gooin hooam.'"</span><br>

</p>

<p>Aw gave his hand a hearty shake,<br>

It seem'd as tho' the words he spake<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sank i' mi heart:</span><br>

Aw walk'd away a wiser man,<br>

Detarmined aw wod try his plan<br>

I' hopes at last 'at aw might be<br>

As weel assured ov Heaven as he;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That's th' better part.</span></p>

Agean.</h2>

Aw've a rare lump o' beef on a dish,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We've some bacon 'at's
hung up o' th' thack,</span><br>

We've as mich gooid spike-cake as we wish,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' wi' currens its
varry near black;</span><br>

We've a barrel o' gooid hooam brewed drink,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We've a pack o' flaar
reared agean th' clock,</span><br>

We've a load o' puttates under th' sink,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So we're pretty weel off
as to jock.</span><br>

Aw'm soa fain aw can't tell whear to bide,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But the cause aw dar
hardly let aat;</span><br>

It suits me moor nor all else beside;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Aw've a paand 'at th'
wife knows nowt abaat.<br>

<br>

</span>Aw can nah have a spree to misel?<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Aw can treat mi old
mates wi' a glass;</span><br>

An' aw sha'nt ha' to come home an' tell<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My old lass, ha' aw've
shut all mi brass.</span><br>

Some fowk say, when a chap's getten wed,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He should nivver keep
owt thro' his wife;</span><br>

If he does awve oft heard 'at it's sed,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'At it's sure to breed
trouble an' strife;</span><br>

If it does aw'm net baan to throw up,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Tho' aw'd mich rayther
get on withaat;</span><br>

But who wodn't risk a blow up,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For a paand 'at th' wife
knows nowt abaat.<br>

<br>

</span>Aw hid it i' th' coil hoil last neet,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For fear it dropt aat o'
mi fob,</span><br>

Coss aw knew, if shoo happened to see 't,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">At mi frolic wod prove a
done job.</span><br>

But aw'll gladden mi een wi' its face,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To mak sure at its safe
in its nick;&mdash;</span><br>

But aw'm blest if ther's owt left i' th' place!<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Why, its hook'd it as
sure as aw'm wick.</span><br>

Whear its gooan to's a puzzle to me,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' who's taen it aw
connot mak aat,</span><br>

For it connot be th' wife, coss you see<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It's a paand 'at shoo
knew nowt abaat.<br>

<br>

</span>But thear shoo is, peepin' off th' side,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' aw see'at shoo's all
on a grin;</span><br>

To chait her aw've monny a time tried,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But I think it's nah
time to give in.</span><br>

A chap may be deep as a well,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But a woman's his
maister when done;</span><br>

He may chuckle and flatter hissel,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But he'll wakken to find
at shoo's won.</span><br>

It's a rayther unpleasant affair,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Yet it's better it's
happened noa daat;</span><br>

Aw'st be fain to come in for a share<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If all they say is true,</span><br>

Its length war five foot eight or nine,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Its height wor four foot
two;</span><br>

An' when it coom to th' pig hoil door,<br>

Unless it went daan ov its knees,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' that it wodn't do.<br>

<br>

</span>Then Billy's mother coomed to help,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' hit it wi' a mop;</span><br>

But thear it wor, an' thear it seem'd<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Detarmined it 'ud stop;</span><br>

But all at once it gave a grunt,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' oppen'd sich a shop;</span><br>

An' finding aat 'at it wor lick'd,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It laup'd clean ovver

<br>

</span>His mother then shoo shook her heead,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' pool'd a woeful face;</span><br>

"William," shoo sed, "tha shouldn't bring<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sich things as theas to

But if tha buys sich things as thease<br>

<br>

</span>"Nah, mother, niver freat." sed Bill,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Its one aw'm goin to

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But its cheap, it is,

<br>

</span>"Well time 'ul try," his mother sed,&mdash;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' time at last did try;</span><br>

For niver sich a hungry beeast<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Had been fed in a sty.</span><br>

"What's th' weight o'th' long legged pig, Billy!"<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wor th' neighbors' daily
cry;</span><br>

"Aw connot tell yo yet," sed Bill,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Aw'll weigh it bye an'

<br>

</span>An' hard poor Billy persevered,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But all to noa avail,</span><br>

It swallow'd all th' mait it could get,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' wod ha' swallow'd

But Billy took gooid care to stand<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">O'th' tother side o'th'
rail;</span><br>

But fat it didn't gain as mich<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As what 'ud greeas its

<br>

</span>Pack after pack o' mail he bowt,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Until he'd bought
fourteen;</span><br>

But net a bit o' difference<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'th' pig wor to be seen:</span><br>

Its legs an' snowt wor just as long<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As iver they had been;</span><br>

Poor Billy caanted rib bi rib<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' heaved a sigh
between.<br>

<br>

</span>One day he, mix'd a double feed,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' put it into th'
troff;</span><br>

"Tha greedy lukkin beeast," he sed,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Aw'll awther stawl thee
off,</span><br>

Or else aw'll brust thi hide&mdash;that is<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Unless 'at its to toff!"</span><br>

An' then he left it wol he went<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His mucky clooas to doff.<br>

<br>

</span>It worn't long befoor he coom<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To see ha matters stood;</span><br>

He luk'd at th' troff, an' thear it wor,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Five simple bits o' wood,</span><br>

As cleean scraped aat as if it had<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ne'er held a bit o' food;</span><br>

"Tha slotch!" sed Bill, "aw do believe<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Tha'd ait me if tha
could."<br>

<br>

</span>Next day he browt a butcher,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For his patience had
been tried,</span><br>

An' wi a varry deeal to do,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Its legs wi rooap they
tied;</span><br>

An' then his shinin knife he drew<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' stuck it in its

It mud ha been a crockadile,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Bi th' thickness ov its

<br>

</span>But blooid began to flow, an' then<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Its long legg'd race wor
run;</span><br>

They scalded, scraped, an' hung it up,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' when it all wor done,</span><br>

Fowk coom to guess what weight it wor,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And mony a bit o' fun</span><br>

He luk'd at th' pig&mdash;then daan he set,<br>

Poor Billy he could hardly bide,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To sit an' hear ther

Then up he jumped, an' off he run,<br>

Traitle Sop.</h2>

Once in a little country taan<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A grocer kept a shop,</span><br>

And sell'd amang his other things,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Prime traitle drink and
pop,<br>

<br>

</span>Teah, coffee, currans, spenish juice,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Soft soap an' paader
blue,</span><br>

Presarves an' pickles, cinnamon,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Allspice an' pepper too;<br>

<br>

</span>An' hoasts o' other sooarts o' stuff<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To sell to sich as came,</span><br>

As figs, an' raisens, salt an' spice,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Too numerous to name.<br>

<br>

</span>One summer's day a waggon stood<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Just opposite his door,</span><br>

An' th' childer all gaped raand as if<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They'd ne'er seen one
afoor;<br>

<br>

</span>An' in it wor a traitle cask,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It wor a wopper too,</span><br>

To get it aat they all wor fast<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which iver way to do;<br>

<br>

</span>But wol they stood an parley'd thear,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Th' horse gave a sudden
chuck,</span><br>

An' aat it flew, an' bursting threw<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All th' traitle into th'
muck.<br>

<br>

</span>Then th' childer laff'd an' clapp'd their hands,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To them it seem'd rare
fun,</span><br>

But th' grocer ommost lost his wits<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When he saw th' traitle
run;<br>

<br>

</span>He stamp'd an' raved, an' then declared<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He wodn't pay a meg,</span><br>

An'th' carter vow'd until he did<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He wodn't stir a peg.<br>

<br>

</span>He said he'd done his business reight,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He'd brought it up to
th' door,</span><br>

An thear it wor, an' noa fair chap<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wad want him to do moor.<br>

<br>

</span>But wol they stamped, an' raved, an' swore,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' vented aat ther
spleen,</span><br>

Th' childer wor thrang enough, you're sure,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All plaisterd up to th'

<br>

</span>A neighbor chap saw th' state o' things,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' pitied ther distress,</span><br>

An' begg'd em not to be soa sour<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Abaat soa sweet a mess;<br>

<br>

</span>"An' tha'd be sour," th'owd grocer said,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If th' job wor thine,
owd lad,</span><br>

An' somdy wanted thee to pay<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For what tha'd niver had.<br>

</span>"Th' fault isn't mine," said th' cart driver<br>

I've brought him traitle, thear it is,<br>

<br>

</span>This didn't suit th' young lads a bit,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They didn't mean to stop,</span><br>

They felt detarmin'd 'at they'd get<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Another traitle sop.<br>

<br>

</span>They tried all ways, but th' chap stood firm,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They couldn't get a lick,</span><br>

An' some o' th' boldest gate a taste<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">O'th neighbor's walkin

<br>

</span>At last one said, I know a plan<br>

We'll knock one daan bang into th' dolt,<br>

He's foorced to pass cloise up this side,<br>

He little dream'd at th' sweets o' life<br>

An' aat he coom a woeful sight,<br>

Then licked him clean an' sent him hooam<br>

grew bigger ivery day, an' he stared at it, an' studied abaght it, wol
when
he luk'd at his wife he could see nowt else, an' he kept dinging her up
wi'
it wol shoo felt varry mich troubled. But one day, as they wor gettin'
ther dinner, he said, "Nay, lass, aw niver did see sich a thing as that
wart o' thy nooas is growing into; if it gooas on tha'll be like a
rhynockoroo or a newnicorn or summat!"</p>

<p>"Well," shoo says, "when tha wed me tha wed th' wart an' all,

doesn't like it tha con lump it."</p>

<p>"Aw've noa need to lump it," he says, "for it's lumpin' itsen
or aw'll gie
nowt for it."</p>

<p>Soa they went on, throo little to moor, till they'd a regular
fratch, an'
as sooin as' he'd getten his dinner, he off to his wark, an' shoo to
her
mother's. When Jim coom back an' fan th' fire aght, an' noa wife, he
felt
rayther strange, but he wor detarmined to let her see 'at he could do
baat
her, soa he gate a bit o' summat to ait an' went to bed. This went on
for
two-o'-three days, an' he wor as miserable as iver he could be, but
o'th'
Setterdy he happened to meet her i'th' shambles, an' they booath
stopped
an' grinned, for they'd nowt agean one another i'th' bothem.</p>

<p>"Nah, lass," he said, "aw think it's abaat time for thee to
come hooam."</p>

<p>"Nay, aw'll come nooan," shoo says, "till aw've getten shut o'

<p>"Oh, ne'er heed that, lass; it doesn't luk hauf as big as it
did, an' if
tha wor all wart, aw'd rayther have thi nor be as aw am."</p>

<p>"Soa shoo went back wi' him, an' throo that time to this he's
allus luk'd
for her beauties asteead ov her faults, an they get on swimmingly. One
day shoo axed him if he thowt th' wart wor ony bigger?" "A'a lass," he

<p>Aw once knew a chap they called old Sammy; he used ta gaa wi a

his rags. Sammy had niver been wed, tho' he war fifty years old, but
it wor allus believed he'd managed ta save a bit a' brass. One day he
war gain up Hepenstull Bunk, Jenny o' Jooans a' th' Long Lover wor

favrite pattern, or her ancles had summat abaat 'em different to what
he'd iver seen befoor, aw cannot tell, but it seems a feelin coom
ovver him all at once, sich as he'd niver had befoor, an' when he'd
managed ta overtak her, he sed, "It's loaning for heeat aw think,
Jenny." "Eea, aw think its likely for bein wut," shoo sed. "Awve
just been thinkin," sed Sammy, "at if I wornt na a single old chap,
aw shouldn't have to trail up an' daan in a lot a' rags like thease,
for awm sure this jacket has hardly strength to hing o' mi rig, an'
mi britches are soa full o' hoils wol awm feeared sometimes when awm

awl tak thi at thi word," he sed: so he pool'd off his coit an gave
it her an' it were arranged 'at he should call for it next neet. You
may bet yor life he didn't forget, an when he saw it mended up, an'
brushed wol it luk'd ommost as gooid as new, he luk'd first at it an

<h2><a name="New_Machinery_c" id="New_Machinery_c"></a>New
Machinery &amp;c.</h2>

<p>It shows varry little sense for fowk to object to a new
machine till
they've tried it, or to fancy it'll be th' means o' smashin th' trade.
Luk at th' paaer looms; when they I wor started all th' hand-loom
weyvers struck wark, becoss they said it ud do 'em all up, an' ther'd
be noa wark at all for weyvers in a bit; but it hasn't turn'd aat soa,
for ther's moor weyvers i'th' country to-day, nor iver ther wor; and
they addle moor brass, an' awm sure they've easier wark. For if this
country doesn't get new machines, other countries will, an' when we're
left behund hand an' connot meet 'em i'th' market, we'st be a deeal
war off nor ony new invention can mak us. All at's been done soa far
has helped to mak us better off. They connot mak a machine to think,
they're forced to stop thear; an' aw dooant daat if we'd to live long
enuff, ther'd be a time when chaps ud ha nowt to do but think-but it's
to be hoaped 'at they'd have summat else to think abaat nor rattenin',
or shooitin', or ruinin' fowk. Aw've tawk'd to some abaat it, an' they
say they're foorced to do sum way to keep wages up, but if aw can tell
em ha to mak brass goa farther, they'll be content to give up th'
Union. But aw think it goas far enuff&mdash;what they want is to
keep it
nearer hooam, to let less on it goa to th' ale haase, to spend less o'
dog feightin', pigeon flyin', an' rat worryin'; an' if they'd niver
spend owt withaat think in' whether it wor for ther gooid or net,
they'd find a deal moor brass i'th' drawer corner at th' month end,
an' varry likely a nice little bit to fall back on i'th' Savings bank
at th' year end. An a chap stands hauf an inch heigher when he's a
bankbook in his pocket; an' butchers and grocers varry sooin begin to
nod at him, an' ax if they can do owt for him. But if he goas on
th'strap, an' happens to be a month behund, he's foorced to stand o'
one side till iverybody else gets sarved, an' then if he doesn't like
what's left they tell him to goa leave it. It isn't what a chap
addles, it's what a chap saves 'at makes him rich.</p>

<p>Sellin' drink has made mony a chap rich, an suppin it has made
thaasands poor. But still aw must honestly say 'at aw cannot agree
wi' teetotalism altogether. If noa men gate drunken, ther'd be noa
need for anybody to sign th' pledge;&mdash;an' aw dooant think they
goa
th' reight way to get fowk to be sober. They publish papers, but what
use is made on em? Yo hardly iver see a midden emptied but what yo'll
find two or three pieces o'th' "British Workman," or th' "Temperance
Advocate" flyin' abaat; an' they hold meetings an' spend a sight o'
brass o' printin' an' praichin', an' still they doant mak one
teetotaller 'at ov a thaasand. Aw should advise em to try this way.
Let em offer a &pound;500 prize for him 'at can invent a drink as
gooid
takin' as ale&mdash;an' one, 'at willn't mak fowk drunk. Chaps mun
sup
summat when they're away throo hooam, an it is'nt iverybody's stumach
'at's strong enuff to tak watter, unless it's let daan wi summat; an'
ther is noa teetotal drink invented yet 'at's any better nor Spenish-
juice-watter. They're all like pap. Coffee an' tea are all weel enuff,
but if yo want that yo munnot goa to a Temperance Hotel for it. Aw'ye
tried it monny a scoor times, but aw niver gate owt fit to sup, an' if
it hadn't been for th' drop o' rum aw gate 'em to put into it, aw
couldn't ha swallowed it. Tea an' coffee are things 'at dooant mend
wi' warmin up, an' yo connot allus wait woll fowk mak it, an' soa if
yo want to sup yo mun awther goa an' beg a drop o' watter, or pay
fourpence for a glass o' belly vengeance, or yo mun get a glass o'
drink&mdash;but yo've noa need to get a dozzen. Teetotallers say it
contains poison, an' noa daat it does&mdash;but it's of a varry

<h2><a name="September_Month" id="September_Month"></a>September
Month.</h2>

<p>Blackberries are ripe in September, an' we may consider th'
year's
ripe, for when this month gets turned, things 'll begin o' gooin' th'
back way. Its vany wonderful when we look reight at it. This world's
a wonderful spot, an' ther's a deal o' wonderful things in it. Ther's
some things at it's varry wonderful to see, an' ther's some things' at
it's wonderful net to see. Aw thowt it wor varry wonderful, a week or
two sin', when aw pass'd Stanninley Station, 'at ther worn't a chap
wi' a dog under his arm; it's th' furst time aw iver pass'd an' didn't
see one. But aw niver think it's wonderful for ther to be a fooil in
a company; an' aw dooant think its wonderful when aw find 'at th'
biggest fooil has allus th' mooast to say.</p>

<p>Nah, its a varry nice time o'th' year is this for fowk to have
a bit
of a pic-nic;&mdash;aw dooant know owt 'at's a better excuse for a
chap to
tighten his belly-band nor a pic-nic, becoss iverybody taks twice as
mich stuff to ait as they know they'll want, for fear fowk might think
they wor shabby. If yo get a invite to a doo o' that mak', be sure yo
goa, if you've owt of a twist. But talkin' abaat invites maks me
study a bit. When yo get an invitation, allus think it ovver befoor
yo tak' it Ax yorsen one or two questions abaat it. If yo think it's
becoss yo can play th' peanner, or becoss yo can sing&mdash;tell
'em
yorterms. If yo think it's becoss some owd uncle is likely to dee an'
leeav yo a lot o' brass, an' they've a dowter or two 'at isn't
wed&mdash;
tell 'em yor engaged (to a lady). If yo think it's becoss they fancy
yor a shinin' leet&mdash;tell 'em yo're gooan aat. I yo think it's
becoss
they want to borrow some brass, an' yor daatful whether yo'll iver get
it back agean&mdash;tell 'em yo've soa monny calls made on yo, wall
yo're
feeard yo connot call o' them at present. But if yo think it's just
becoss they want yo, an' they'll be glad to see yo,' put on yor hat
an' off in a minit.</p>

<p>Aw once knew a chap 'at had getten a invite to a doo, an' he
wor
gooin' to tak his wife wi' him; an' he wor tellin' some mates what a
shimmer shoo wor gooin' to cut. "Mun," he says, "sho'll just luk like
one o' them figures i'th' waxworks! Aw've bowt her a goold cheen as
thick as my thum; it's cost ornmost a paand. An' tawk abaat a dress!
why, yo' niver saw sich a dress it's a real Mary Antique! Th' chap 'at
sell'd it me, said it had been made for th' Princess o' Wales, but it
wor soa mich brass wol th' Prince couldn't affoord to pay for't, so he
let me have it cheap; an' it's just like buckram&mdash;it'll stand
ov an
end." "Why," said one o'th' chaps, "the Princess willn't be suited if
shoo hears tell 'at thy wife's gettin' it." "Noa," he said, "aw dooant
think shoo wod, but awst noan tell her; an' if shoo gets to know, she
mun try an' put up wi' a bit ov a trial nah an' then. Ther's allus
troubles for th' rich as weel as th' poor." Well! all this gooas to

<h2><a name="Buttermilk_c" id="Buttermilk_c"></a>Buttermilk
&amp;c.</h2>

<p>May is the month for Buttermilk! A doctor once tell'd me it
wor worth
a guinea a pint; he sed it licked cod liver oil, castor oil; or
paraffin oil. Castor oil, he said, war varry gooid for ther bowels,
cod liver oil for ther liver, an' paraffin oil for ther leets (whear
they'd noa gas), but buttermilk wor better nor all three put together,
an' he ad vised me to tak it. "Why," aw sed; "what's th' use o'. me
takkin it when aw dooant ail owt?" "Ther's noa tellin' ha sooin yo
may," he said, "an' an it's a varry simple remedy, yo'd better tak it
whether yo do or net." "Reight enuff," aw sed, "simple things
sometimes do th' best. Aw once knew a woman 'at had been confined to
her bed for twelve year, an' her husband cured her in a minit, after
all th' doctors at th' infirmary had gien her up." Th' doctor pricked
his ears when aw sed soa, an' wanted to know all abaat it, soa aw at
it an' tell'd him. "Sally an' her husband lived at th' Arred Well,
but he oft used to goa as far as th' Coit Hill ova neet to have a pint
an' enjoy an haar or two i' company, an' when he gate haoam he used to
catch it, an' finely too, aw con assure yo, for altho shood ligg'd i'
bed soa long, shoo had'nt lost th' use ov her tongue, an' her felly
said 'at shoo hadn't lost th' use ov her teeth nawther, for shoo could
ait as weel as iver shoo could. One neet as he wor gooin hooam, he
bethowt him he'd try a bit ov a dodge on, for although he felt varry
sooary for his wife, yet he could'nt help thinkin' it wor partly
consait at shoo'd suffer'd throo; soa when he gate in, shoo began a
blowin' into him i' fine style. 'Th' owd time, lad! It shows what tha
cares for me! Aw hav'nt had a wick soul to spaik to sin tha went aat,
but it's all one to thee! Tha'll come hooam some time an' find me
ligg'd deead, an' then tha can spree abaat throo morm to neet.' 'Nay,
lass, aw dooant think aw should spree abaat any moor nor aw do nah.
But who does ta think aw met to neet?' he said. 'Ah know nowt abaat
it, nor care nawther.' 'Why, but as aw war comin' up bith' Brayvet
Gate, aw met Betty Earnshaw, an' soa aw went gaiterds wi her a bit,
an' that's reason aw'm soa lat.' 'Oh! tha mud weel be lat! Shoo war
an' owd sweetheart o' thine, wor Betty.' 'Eea, shoo war axin me ha
tha wor gettin' on, shoo seems vany sooary for thi.' 'Sooary be
hanged! aw want nooan ov her sooarys! If shoo could nobbut get me aat
o' th' gate, shoo'd be all reight. Did shoo ax when tha thowt tha'd be
at liberty?' 'Nay shoo did'nt, but shoo did say at shoo thowt tha
lasted long, but shoo pitied thee an' me.' 'Pitied thee, did shoo!
An' what did shoo pity thi for, aw should like to know? Shoo happen
thowt shoo could do better for thee nor what aw've done, but if shoo
wor as badly as me shood know summat. 'Eea, but shoo isn't, for aw
nivver saw her luk better i' mi life, an' shoo talks abaat commin'
i'th' morn in' to clean up for thi a bit; aw sed tha'd be fain to see
her, an' tha sees if owt should happen thee, shadd be getten into th'
way a bit, an' begin to feel moor used to th' haase.' 'Niver! wol my
heart's warm, Tom. Aw'll niver have sich a huzzy i'th' haase, wheal'
aw am! aw'm nooan done wi yet! aw'll live a bit longer to plague yo
wi', an' as for cleanin', aw'll crawl abaat o' mi hands an' knees
afoor shoo shall do owt for me! Yo think aw'm poorly an' soa aw'm to
be trodden on, but aw'll let yo see awm worth a dozen deead uns yet;
nasty owd ponse as shoo is!" An' as sure as yor thear, Doctor, shoo
gate up th' next morn in' an' kinneld th' fair, an' when Tom coom hoam
to his braikfast all wor ready, an' shoo wor set daan at th' table wi
a clean cap on, an' lukkin as smart as smart could be. When th' chap
saw this, he said, "Lass, aw think aw'd better send Betty backward,"
"Eea, aw think tha had," shoo sed, "an' th'a can send her word throo
me 'at aw may live to donee on her gravestooan yet." Tom bafs in his
sleeve a bit sometimes, an' if iver one ov her owd fits seems likely
ta come on, he's nowt to do but say a word or two abaat Betty, an'
shoo's reight in a minnit. That licks buttermilk, Doctor.</p>

<h2><a name="Its_a_comfort" id="Its_a_comfort"></a>It's
a comfort.</h2>

<p>It's a comfort a chap can do withaat what he connot get. It
feels
hard to have to do wi' less nor what a body has at present, but if it
has to be it will be, an' it's cappin' ha' fowk manage to pool throo
haiver bad th' job is. It's naa use for a chap to keep longin' for
sum mat better, unless he's willin' to buckle to, an' work for it; an'
a chap wi' an independent mind ne'er freeats becoss he hasn't all he
wants; he sets hissen to get it, an' if he's detarmined he oft
succeeds, an' if net he doesn't sit daan an' mump, but up an' at it
agean. Havin' a lot o' brass doesn't mak a chap happy, but spend in'
it may do, an' if a chap's wise he'll try to spend it in a way 'at'll
bring happiness for a long time to come. Ther's some fowk feeared 'at
they con niver spend brass safely; they're allus freeten'd of loisin'
it; but they've noa need, for if they spent it i' dooin' gooid,
they'll allus be sure o' gooid interest, for they'll be pleased every
time they think on it. Nah, ther's some things i' this world 'at yo
connot looise. It's a varry easy thing to loise a cork aat ov a
bottle, but it's impossible to loise th' hoil aat ov a bottle neck.
Yo may braik th' bottle all to pieces, but th' hoil is somewhear; it
nobbut wants another bit o' glass twistin' raand it, an' yo'll find
it's as gooid as iver it wor, an' it's just soa wi' a gooid action; yo
may loise th' seet on it, but it's somewhear abaat; it nobbut wants
circumstances twistin' raand it, an' yo'll find it's
thear&mdash;it's niver
lost. If fowk 'ud get into this way o' thinkin', ther'd be a deal
moor gooid done nor ther is. Haiver mich brass a chap has, if he's
moor wants nor he con satisfy, he's poor enuff; an' aw think if fowk
'ud spend a bit less time i' tryin' to get rich, an' a bit moor i'
tryin' to lessen ther wants, they'd be moor comfortable bi th' hauf.
But yo' may carry things too far even i' savin'. Aw once knew a chap
'at wor a regular skinflint; he'd gie nowt&mdash;noa, net as mich
as a
crumb to a burd; an' if iver any wor seen abaat his haase they used to
be sat daan to be young ens 'at hadn't le'nt wit. Well, he once went
to buy a seck o' coils, an' to be able to get 'em cheaper he fetched
'em throo th' pit; it wor th' depth o' winter, but as he had to hug
'em two mile it made th' sweeat roll off him.. When he gate hooam he
put 'em daan an' shook his heead. "By gow," he sed, "awm ommost done,
but aw'll mak' yo' pay for this, for aw willn't burn another coil this
winter." An' he stuck, to his word, an' wheniver he wor starved, he
used to get th' seck o' coils ov his back an' walk raand th' haase
till he gat warm agean&mdash;an' he says they're likely to fit him
his bit
o' rime aat. "Well," yo'n say, "that chap wor a fooil," an' aw think
soa misen, an' varry likely if he'd seen us do some things he'd think
we wor fooils. We dooant allus see things i'th' same leet&mdash;for
instance, a pompus chap wor once tawkin' to me abaat his father. "My
father," he said, "was a carver and gilder, an' he once carved a calf
so naturally that you would fancy you could hear it bleat." "Well, aw
didn't know thi father," aw sed, "but aw know thi mother once cauved
one, for aw've heeard it bleat." Yo' should just ha' seen him when aw
sed soa!&mdash;didn't he pull th' blinds daan, crickey!</p>

<h2><a name="Progress" id="Progress"></a>Progress.</h2>

<p>This is the age of progress; and it is not slo progress
nawther. The
worst on it is, we're all forced to go on whether we like it or net,
for if we stand still a minit, ther's somedy traidin' ov us heels, an'
unless we move on they'll walk ovver us, an' then when we see them
ommost at top o'th' hill, we shall find us sen grubbin' i'th' muck at
th' bottom. A chap mun have his wits abaat him at this day or else
he'll sooin' be left behund. Ther's some absent minded fowk think
they get on varry weel i'th' owd way an' they're quite content, but
its nobbut becoss they're too absent minded to see ha mich better they
mud ha done if they'd wakken'd up a bit sooiner. Aw once knew a varry
absent minded chap; he wur allus dooin' some sooart o' wrang heeaded
tricks. Aw' remember once we'd booath to sleep i' one bed, an aw gate
in fust, an' when aw luk'd to see if he wor commin', aw'm blow'd! if
he hadn't put his cloas into bed an hung hissen ovver th' cheer back.
Awm sure aw connot tell where all this marchin' is likely to lead us
to at last, but aw hooap we shall be all reight, for aw do think
ther's plenty o' room to mend even yet, but the deuce on it is,'
ther's soa monny different notions abaat what is reight wol aw'm
flamigaster'd amang it. Some say drink is the besetting sin; another
says 'bacca is man's ruination. One says we're all goin' to the devil
becoss we goa to church, an' another says we'st niver goa to heaven if
we goa to th' chapel, but aw dooant let ony o' them things bother me.
'At ther is a deeal o' sin i'th' world aw dooant deny, an', aw think
ther is one 'at just bears th' same relation to other sins as a split
ring bears to a bunch o' keys; it's one 'at all t'other things on: an'
that's&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">selfishness</span>,
an we've all sadly too mich o' that. We follow
that "number one" doctrine sadly too mich,&mdash;iverybody seems

advice,
ther's any on 'em ready enuff to give that; but if advice wor stuff
'at they could buy potatoes wi', ther' wodn't be as mich o' that
knockin' abaat for nowt as ther' is).</p>

<p>We're all varry apt to know the messur o' ivrybody's heead but
us own;
we can tell when a cap fits them directly, but we con niver tell when
ther's one 'at just fits us. Miss Parsnip said last Sunday, when
shoo'd been to th' chapel, "at shoo wondered ha Mrs. Cauliflaar could
fashion to hold her heead up, for shoo niver heeard a praicher hit
onybody harder in all her life," An' Mrs. Cauliflaar tell'd me "'at if
shoo wor Miss Parsnip shoo'd niver put her heead i' that chapel
ageean, for iverybody knew 'at he meant her' when he wor tawkin' abaat
backbitin'." An'soa it is; we luk at other fowk's faults through th'
thin end o' th' spy glass, but when we want to look at us own, we turn
it raand.</p>

bin used to, shoo hit her neet cap agean th' top an' fell back wi a
reglar sass. "Whativer is ther to do, Sammy," shoo sed, as sooin as
shoo could spaik, "strike a leet' wi ta!" Sammy gate a leet, an'
blushed an ovver his face, for it wor th' fust time onybody had seen
him dressed that way sin he wor a little lad. "Aw dooant know what
ther is to do," he sed, "but aw cannot bide i' that bed, an' that's a
fact." "What!" shoo says, "are ta ruein' o' thi bargain bi nah? but
tha's no need to freat, for aw con spare thee at ony time." "Nay,
Jenny," he sed, it's nooan thee 'at maks me uneasy, but aw fancy
ther's summat wick i' that bed besides thee an' me.' "Is ther," shoo
said, an' shoo flew off one side; "why whativer is it, thinks ta?"
Sammy turned daan th' clooas, an' it just luk'd as if sombdy had been
aitin' spice cake an' letten all th' currans drop aat. Tawk abaat
fleas! They worn't fleas! they wor twice as big, an' they wor
marchin' away like a rigiment o' sodgers. He stared wi' all th' een
in his heead, an' shoo started a cryin'. "A'a, to think 'at aw
should iver come to this, to be walked over wi' a lot o' pouse like
that! What mun we do?" "Do! we mun catch 'em, aw expect," he sed,
an' he began wi pickin' 'em off one bi one, an' droppin' 'em into
some water 'at wor cloise by. "Well, mi mother tell'd me," he sed,
"'at when fowk gate wed they began o' ther troubles; an' it's true
an' all, but aw didn't expect owt like this, for if aw'd known, aw'd
ha' seen th' weddin' far enough; aw did think 'at a chap wad be able
to get a neet's rest anyway." "Tha can goa back to thi mother," shoo
sed, "an' stop wi' her for owt aw care, an' aw wish tha'd niver left
her, for aw'st get mi deeath o' cold wi' paddlin' abaat wi' nowt on;
but does ta think tha's catched 'em all?" "Aw think soa, an' if tha's
a mind we'll get to bed agean." "Nay, tha can goa to thi mother as
tha freats soa," shoo sed. "Tak noa noatice o' what aw sed," sed
Sammy, "tha knows aw wor put abaat a bit, an' it war all for th' sake
o' thee." "Tha'll tell me owt," shoo sed, "put th' leet aat, an'
let's see if we con get a bit o' gradely sleep." They gate into bed
once more, an' shoo wor off to sleep in a minit, but Sammy wor
rubbin' an' scrattin' hissen. "Wen, aw've heeard tell abaat things
bein' ball proof and bomb proof, but aw niver knew 'at anybody wor
bug proof befoor." Wi' him knockin' abaat soa mich shoo wakken'd
agean. "Nay, Sammy," shoo sed, "aw'm reight fair stawld, it's all
consait, aw'm sure it is." "Consait be hanged!" he bawled aat, "just
feel at that blister an' then tell me if it's all consait." Nowt
could keep awther on 'em 'i bed after that, an' they paraded abaat
all th' neet like two gooasts, wait in' for th' cock crow. Mornin'
did come at last, an' Sammy worn't long befoor' he had th' bed
aatside. "What are ta baan to do wi' it nah?" ax'd his wife. "Aw'm
baan to leave it wheal' it is wol neet," he sed, "an' if they havn't
forgetten which road they coom, aw think ther's as monny as'll be
able to tak it back to Halifax." Next neet they made a bed o'th'
floor, an' slept like tops, an' next mornin' when they gate up, th'
bed wor off. Whether th' cumpny 'at wor in it had taen it or net,
Sammy couldn't tell, but he niver went to seek it. Fowk 'at buy

<p>Aa! ther wor a flare-up at Booith-Taan Hall that neet! It had
been
gein aat 'at they'd to be a meetin' held to elect a new Lord-Mayor,
for New-Taan, Booith-Taan, an' th' Haley Hill, on which particular
occashun, ale ud be supplied at Tuppence a pint upstairs. Ther wor a
rare muster an' a gooid deeal o' argyfyin' tuk place abaat who shud be
th' chearman. But one on 'em&mdash;a sly old fox&mdash;had kept
standin' o' th'
floor sidlin' abaat woll ivery other chear wor full, an' then after
takkin a pinch o' snuff, he said, "Gentlemen, aw see noa reason aw
shuddent tak this place mysen, as iverybody else has getten set daan."
Two or three 'at wor his friends said "Hear, hear," an' two or three
'at worn't said "Sensashun!"</p>

<p>When iverybody's pint had getten fill'd, he blew his nooas,
tuk
another pinch o' snuff, an' stud ov his hind legs to oppen th'
proceedins. "Bergers and Bergeresses," he began, "aw've a varry
unpleasant duty to perform to-neet, which is, namely, to propooas 'at
we have a fresh mayor," (Cries ov "Shame," "Gammon," "Th' mayor we
have is ommost allus fresh!" (etsetra, etsetra etsetra.) "Gentlemen,"
he began agean, "what aw have to say is this,"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Luk sharp an get it said, then," said Stander, th' grocer.</p>

<p>"If tha doesn't hold thy noise, Stander, tha'll get noa moor
snuff off
me, aw con tell thi that; aw mayn't be as flaary a talker as thee, but
what aw say is to'th' point, an' aw think 'at a constituency like
Booith-Taan owt to be represented by somebody ov standin'."</p>

<p>"Better send th' chearman, he's stud den long enuft," said one.</p>

<p>"Prathi sit thi daan, if tha connot talk sense,"
said another.</p>

<p>"Its's time for sombdy to stand summat, for all th' pints is
empty,"
said th' lanlord.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," went on th' chearman, "th' question just
dissolves
itsel' into this: Who has it to be? Has it to be a Doctor sombdy, or
a Professor sombdy, or a Squire sombdy, or has it to be a plain
Maister?"</p>

<p>"Oh I let it be a Squire," said one. "E'ea, Squire Broadbent
ul do,"
said another.</p>

<p>"Nah, lads, yo' 'Ie heeard th' chearman's resolushun, an' aw
sit daan
to call upon Mr. Stander, Esquire, grocer, to address yo."</p>

<p>Th' chearman doubled hissel' into th' shape ov his chear, an'
after
they'd gein ovver pawsin' th' table legs, an' knockin' pint pots,
Stander gate up an' began.</p>

<p>"Fellow Municipallers (hear, hear), aw agree wi' what awr
chearman
says, 'at we owt to have sombdy o' standin' i' society to represent us
for this subsequent year 'at's forthcomin'."</p>

<p>"Tha happen want's to get one o' thi own relations in," said
Snittle.</p>

<p>"It ud seem thee better to keep thi maath shut, Snittle, till
tha's
paid me for yond Garman Yeast."&mdash;(Shame, shame.)</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, aw propooas 'at this meetin' dissolves itsel' into
a
depitation to visit Professor Holloway, to ax him if he'll represent
us for th' next year. Aw dooant know him mysen, but we've all heeard
tell on him, an' we've seen his pills an' ointment advertised, an' aw
think he'd be a varry likely man to work awr business to th' best
interest ov the whole communicants; an' noa daat he'd be able to heal
up ony bits o' unpleasantness 'at's been caused wi' this election. Aw
believe him to be a varry pushin' man, an' one ov a spyring natur; for
as Elijah Barrett says (i' his book on leeanin' to blacksmith), 'One
inch the heighest,' seems to be the motto he works on, for goa where
yo will yo'll allus see one o' his bills a bit heigher nor onybody's
else, an for that reason aw beg to propooas 'at he should be acceptted
as a fit an' proper person.</p>

<p>The chearman stood up an' axed "ony chap to I say owt agean
that 'at
dar." Up jumped Billy Bartle, an' said, "Aw object to that in total;
aw see noa reason to goa to Lunnon to find a mayor, soa long as
we've professors at hooam, an aw propoosas 'at we ax&mdash;" ("Shut
up!
shut up!" "Ta' hold, an' sup." "Gooid lad, Billy,") etsetra,
etsetra. etsetra.</p>

<p>Just then th' lanlord coom in an' turn'd off th' gas, for he
said
"they hadn't spent aboon eighteen pence all th' neet."</p>

<p>Th' chearman said he thowt they couldn't do better nor all
have a
pinch o' snuff wi' him, an' have a pint i'th' kitchen woll they talked
things ovver; soa they went daan th' stairs, an' somha they managed to
re-elect th' owd en afoor they went hooam, an' six on em hugged him o'

Aw varrily believe 'at one hauf on 'em niver oppen the maath throo th'

<p>What suits one body doesn't suit another. Aw niver knew two
fowk 'at
allus thowt alike; an' if yo iver heard a poor chap talkin' abaat
somebdy 'ats weel off, he's sure to say 'at if he'd his brass he'd do
different throo what they do.</p>

<p>Aw once heeard a chap say 'at if he'd as mich brass as Baron
Rothschild he'd niver do owt but ait beef-steaks an' ride i' cabs.
Well, lad, aw thowt, it's better tha hasn't it. We're all varry apt
to find fault wi' things at we know varry little abaat, an' happen if
we knew mooar we shud say less. Aw once heeard two lasses talkin',
an' one on 'em war tellin' tother 'at sin shoo saw her befoor, shoo'd
getten wed, an' had a child, an' buried it. "Why, whativer shall aw
live to hear? Aw didn't know 'at tha'd begun coortin'. Whoiver has ta
getten wed to?" "Oh, awve getten wed to a forriner, at comes throo
Staffordshur."</p>

<p>"Well, aw hooap, tha's done weel, lass; awm sure aw do. And
what does
he do for a livin'?" "Why, its rayther a queer trade; but he stails
pots." "Stails pots, Betty! A'a aw wonder ha tha could bring thisen
daan to wed a chap o' that sooart. Aw'll keep single for iver, woll
awm green maald, afoor aw'll wed ony chap unless he gets his livin'
honestly." "Aw should like to meet ony body 'at says he doesn't get
his livin' honestly," says Betty; "nah thee mark that." "Well, Betty,
that maks noa difference to me; but aw say agean 'at noa chap gets his
livin' honestly 'at stails&mdash;noa matter whether he stails pots
or
parkins." "Why, Nancy, aw thowt tha'd moor sense, aw did for

aw mean, his trade is to put stails on to pots." "Oh! A'a! E'e! tha

understond." "Ther's monny a one has a deeal to say abaat things 'at

<p>An' aw believe that's true; but at th' same time it's as weel
to be

luk a deeal nicer, an' moor agreeabler, when they're oppened aat to
shake hands wi yo, nor what they do when doubled up i'th' front o' yor
nooas. Soa yo see, yo connot be to careful o' yor words an' deeds, if
yo want to keep straight wi' fowk; an' it's a wise thing to be at
peeace. And if this is a unsettled time o' th' year, that's noa
reason 'at yo should be unsettled. But as it isn't iverybody's lot to
know ha to get on smoothly, aw'll just give yo a bit o' advice; an' if
yo learn that, an' act on it, yo'll niver rue th' brass yo've spent,

th' furst, wi' th' youngest child in his arms, an' one or two rayther
bigger poolin' 'at his coit laps, an' just behund is his owd lass,
puffin' and blowin' like a steam engine, her face as red as a rising

corner on it yo con see a black bottle neck peepin' aat. At th' side
on her walks th' owdest lass; an' isn't shoo doin' it grand for owt
shoo knows! Luk what fine ribbons shoo has flyin' daan her back, an' a
brass ring ov her finger, varry near big enuff to mak a dog's collar

tother, 'at shoo defies awther yo or onybody else to tell 'at shoo's
nobbut a calico wayver when shoo's at hooam. But they get aside o'th'
watter at last. "Ha! what a wopper!" says one o'th' lads, as a wave
comes rollin' ovver. "A'a! but that's a gurter!" says another. Then
th' father an' th' mother puts th' young uns all in a row, an' tell
'em all to luk at th' sea&mdash;as if ther wor owt else to luk at

Blackpool. But yo may see at th' owd lass isn't comfortable, for shoo

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
